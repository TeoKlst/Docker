\\\to do///
From an alpine image 
you’ll add to your container your favorite text editor, vim or emacs, 
that will launch along with your container.

\\\to to run dockerfile///

-t is the Docker image tag. You can give a name to your image and a tag.
The second parameter (a ‘.’) specifies the location of the Dockerfile that we created.
Since we created the Dockerfile in the same folder in which we are running the docker build, we specified the current directory.
	
$ docker build -t myimage:latest .
